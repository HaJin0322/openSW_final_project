# Create a README file to explain your package including some explanation about the model, the hyperparameter, and your codes.

I create a classification object: Logistic Regression.
I tuned some hyperpameters(C=100.0, max_iter=300) from default.
Then, I fit the object to training dataset.
And then, I predict the label of test data point(X_test), and print the occuracy between y_test and y_pred.
